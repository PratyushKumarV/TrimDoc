# TrimDoc  

A PDF manipulation Chrome extension that simplifies compressing and splitting PDFs.


## ✨ Features  
- **Compress PDFs** directly in your browser.  
- **Split PDFs** into multiple files without leaving Chrome.

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express  


## 📦 Prerequisites  

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **v22+** (npm included) installed locally.  
  > npm ships with Node.js, so installing Node.js gives you npm automatically.

## 📝 External API

This extension uses the [ILovePDF API](https://developer.ilovepdf.com/docs) for PDF manipulation (compressing and splitting PDFs).  
You’ll need to sign up for an API key to use the backend locally. See their documentation for more details.
> Note: The backend already has an API key configured. You don’t need to set up your own to use the hosted version.
